1. FOR LOOP WITHOUT AN 'IN' KEYWORD

Without the 'in' keyword, the control variable in a loop assumes values from the command line, i.e. $1, $2, etc. One at a time. This allows us to conveniently iterate through the arguments.

for VAR
do
   ... body
done

@@
2. FOR VAR IN CONSTRUCT

for VAR in val1 val2 val3
do
    ... body
done

This will iterate through val1, val2, val3.

3. A C-LIKE FOR CONSTRUCT

for ((i=0; i<$count; i++))
do
    ... body
done

We have (( )) here for an arithmetical expression. Spaces are not important here. Comparison is allowed as in C. Increments are allowed just as in C, i.e. ++, --, i=i+2 are allowed.
