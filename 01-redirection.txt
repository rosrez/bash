Redirecting stdout:

wc < file

Redirecting stdout:

ls -l file > lsout

Redirecting stderr:

ls -l file 2> lserr

Combining redirection of stdout and stderr:

ls -l file > lsout 2> lserr

Redirecting to the same target:

ls -l file &> lsboth

Redirect stderr to the same file descriptor as stderr:

ls -l file > lsout 2>&1

NOTE that the order is important while redirecting to the same descriptor. This command is different from the previous one:

ls -l file 2>&1 > lsout

First, this command redirects stderr to stdout (which is the terminal) and THEN redirects stdout to the lsout file.

Combine redirection with pipe:

ls file 2>&1 | wc

This redirects ls's stdin to stdout and then pipes stdout to wc.
