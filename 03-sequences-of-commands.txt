Syntax for running a program in the background:

./somecommand &

When the command finishes, the shell will display a message [1] Done ./somework.

----------------------

Lumping several related commands together:

pwd; ls

----------------------

We can wait until a background job finishes:

$ ./somework &
[1] 23633

$ wait 23633
[1]+ Done      ./somework

The wait command did not return until ./somework completed.

---------------------

We can start several processes in the background and wait for all of them to complete with the wait command like this:

$ ./somework &

$ ./morework &

wait                <---- WAITS FOR BOTH
