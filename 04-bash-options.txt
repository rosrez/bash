bash -n
-------
Doesn't run the script but checks the syntax.

bash -v
-------
Will echo out as it reads it (while running the script at the same time, so the output of bash and the script is interleaved).

bash -x
-------
This will echo out commands as it is about to execute it.

EXAMPLE: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN -v and -x.

We have a script pwd_ls.sh:

++++++
# where we are
pwd
# what files we have
ls
++++++

If we invoke bash -v pwd_ls.sh, the output is this:

# where we are
pwd
/home/admin/src/shell/bash
# what files we have
ls

So, bash has just output it line by line, including comments.

Now, if we invoke bash -x pwd_ls.sh, the output will be:

+ pwd
/home/admin/src/shell/bash
+ ls
01-redirection.txt  02-heredoc.txt  03-sequences-of-commands.txt  phonebook  pwd_ls.sh

Comments are ignored because they are not executable statements.
